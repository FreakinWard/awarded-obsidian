**What:** 
Awarded Templates is an an Obsidian tool providing a set of note templates for common use cases.

**Context:** 
These templates guide my Obsidian vault creation and organization. Having a systematic approach to note creation and organization helps me stay organized and productive.

**Problem:** 
As a professional Software Engineer, I need a way to track, organize and document the people and projects I work with on a daily basis.

Typically, I work with many people across the organization on several different projects and initiatives. Each have their own unique needs, details, and goals. Often times, they're interconnected in some ways. Having the ability to capture the plethora of details helps me make sense of the complexity and focus on the bigger picture.

**Solution:** 
Awarded Templates is a set of templates that I use to create notes that I find useful in my daily work. I use them for a variety of purposes, but I think they're a great way to get started.

## Features

- Effortless Templates: Quickly create meeting notes, personal notes, and more.
- Automated Organization: Notes are sorted and placed exactly where they belong.
- Linked Information: View related mentions, meetings, and 1-on-1s with ease.
- Visual Dashboards: Track recent notes, tasks, and activities in one glance.

### Templates

Templates are used to create notes that are automatically sorted and linked to other notes. They're a great way to get started with note creation and organization. 

In general, templates share this common behavior:
- When a note is created from a template, it will automatically be named and organized into the correct location.
- When the note already exists, then it will be opened.
- When the note is already open, then it will be brought into focus.
