# Overview

What: Awarded Templates is an Obsidian template vault based on [Ever Green Vault](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV3aPPnTIVj4LNDOXPiAlemUoD-LG_T3M) by [Construct By Dee](https://www.constructbydee.com/).

Context: These templates guide my Obsidian vault creation and organization. Having a systematic approach to note creation and organization helps me stay organized and productive.

Problem: As a professional Software Engineer, I need a way to track, organize and document the people and projects I work with on a daily basis.

Typically, I work with many people across the organization on several different projects and initiatives. Each have their own unique needs, details, and goals. Often times, they're interconnected in some ways. Having the ability to capture the plethora of details helps me make sense of the complexity and focus on the bigger picture.

Solution: Awarded Templates is a set of templates that I use to create notes that I find useful in my daily work. I use them for a variety of purposes, but I think they're a great way to get started.
