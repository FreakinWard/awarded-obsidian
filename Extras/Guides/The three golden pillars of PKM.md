## There is only three things to keep in mind

- (1) Capture
- (2) Retrieve
- (3) (Re)- Emerge

Think of these as your foundation - without these your system falls flat. Everything else you build on top of this infrastructure adds to a better system, but without these three golden pillars your system will fall flat. 

This is why it is important to implement these three first, understand them deeply, and consult back to them whenever you feel disorganized, lost, or concerned that your PKM is getting out of hand.

At first glance it seems simple, but the most delicious 5-star restaurant meals are sometimes made with only one or two ingredients - it is how you use and combine them that decides the end result

### (1) First up we have Capture.

Any and all information that enters your system gets captured in a way. Is it easy? Is it difficult? Are you experiencing a lot of friction? Do you come back to your system enough? 

The first step is perhaps the most important, because you can't retrieve what you don't have. Put thought into what information you want to enter into your knowledge sphere, take time to remove any friction elements which may cause you to stop using the system, but this starts with noticing something that does not feel right or feels off to you about the information capturing process. 

The first and second pillar has some overlap. When you enter information, you need to think of the future "you". Where will future you be looking for this information? Where would they likely go look for it if they want to retrieve it? Are you creating multiple channels for them to retrieve it?

We use the LOGREDIS (Log Relate Discover) methodology combined with the Daily Notes First Methodology to input all our thoughts and ideas in a structured way with the appropriate hashtags to make sure these notes/thoughts/ideas get pushed through to the place where future you would need them.

### (2) Secondly we have Retrieve.

We have placed our new knowledge/ideas/thoughts/information in our system in the correct format with the correct tags and links to the appropriate pages. Finding these informational pieces should be easy. Right?

Not always.

Have you ever looked for your keys in your own house? You generally have the same spot for it, but sometimes past you is not the freshest peach in the box. You leave it in odd places, and an hour later you find it behind your feet-pic drawer in-side of a packet of marshmallows. 

This is a programming error. Your algorithm of where to place your keys are right most of the time, but there's still a bug. You need to place the keys in the first place that you looked, and make sure you have the right prompt to leave for yourself.

Same with your digital life. Think deeply about where this information would need to go to, and if you are in the future trying to retrieve information that you places in your system already - put yourself in past-peach-you's shoes.

Retrieval should happen within seconds - anything longer and you'll need to do some refining and updating of your input algorithm

### (3) Lastly we have (Re)-emerge.

I say Re-emerge or emerge because both happens. This step is by far the part where those brilliant ideas are born from. This step happens by your PKM system TALKING BACK to you! These are those serendipitous moments of creating a new page and seeing a note with a similar name pop up that you created 3 years ago exploring the same/related topic. You dive into that note to explore your past notes and ideas. Other notes come in the form of tags - when you search for a specific tag and all the notes and logs you have bestowed with this specific tag pops up to allow you to re-explore and use and interact with! 

Some of my most serendipitous moments also came from "today one year ago" which I referenced last years journal entry in my daily note for today. Concepts I was exploring, things I were working on, podcast that I listened to, people that I spoke to become valuable inputs to the problems and challenges I'm facing one year later.
