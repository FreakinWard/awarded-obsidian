## Project Management for Individual Responsibilities: A Self-Centric Approach

When it comes to project management, there's often an assumption that it's all about overseeing a team, assigning tasks, and ensuring that everyone meets their respective deadlines. This, however, is only one facet of the discipline.

Here, we'll explore project management from a different angle — focusing solely on _managing your own responsibilities_ within various projects, irrespective of whether you're working in a team or solo.

**Clarification:**  
This isn't about managing a team or delegating tasks to others. Instead, it's about organizing, prioritizing, and tracking all the tasks and responsibilities that fall directly onto your plate. Think of it as 'self-project management.'
