## What is LogReDis?

Logredis is the methodology I came up with for processing stray bits of information. The main aim is to turn information that easily gets lost into output - becoming an investment for future **you** to discover.

## It is broken up into 3 areas.
- (1) Log
	- This is where we use the tag and "log::" syntax to log information we come across.
- (2) Relate
	- This is part of the initial logging of the idea, as well as the further exploration. Using a [[Hashtag structure]] in the log itself, or the same hashtag structure in a permanent/atomic note's metadata "tags" fields - it creates a pathway to be found in the future.
- (3) Discover
	- This phase is the "fun" part. Once you have created enough "gravity" for a specific topic 
	- Once you have enough content you can turn it into an output or skill.
