## 1. Create a Project

- Identify the need for a project.
    - Example: You’ve been invited to celebrate New Year’s in Sri Lanka.
- **Create a project:**
    - On your daily note ([[2024-12-01]]), log a "sprint" where you initiate the project.
    - Use the [[Template - Project]] as a starting point to create the project.
- Name the project note: [[Project - Travel to Sri Lanka for Newyears 2024 2025]]
    - **Fill in the metadata:**
        - **up:** Specify the parent of this project. Every project must have a parent to ensure future retrievability.
        - **tags:**
            - `#type/project`: Indicates this is a project (has an end date).
            - `#status/active`: Shows the project is ongoing.
            - Context-specific tags:
                - `#on/sri-lanka`
                - `#on/new-years`
        - **summary:** Provide a short description of the project, including its purpose and success criteria.



## 2. Create Parents

- Once the [[Project - Travel to Sri Lanka for Newyears 2024 2025]] is created, link it to a parent.
- In this example, link it to [[Travel (area)]], which serves as the overarching note for all travel-related projects. This makes it easy to find the project in the future.



## 3. Logs from Daily Notes

- On [[2024-12-01]]:
    - **08:00:** Started the project and created the project note.
    - **17:00:** Logged another sprint, brainstorming ideas and tasks related to the project.
- On [[2024-12-05]]:
    - Created a sprint focused on generating tasks, which were added to the [[Project - Travel to Sri Lanka for Newyears 2024 2025#Tasks and Questions]] section.
- On [[2024-12-08]]:
    - Created the flights document [[Flights Sri Lanka 2024 2025]], which will be referenced in the project note for easy access.



## 4. Child Notes

- On [[2024-12-08]], created [[Flights Sri Lanka 2024 2025]], a note containing flight details.
    - These "child notes" are outputs from your sprints or daily logs, directly linked to the project.
    - Include them in the project note for quick reference.
- After the trip, these notes may no longer be needed, but for now, they provide essential information.
- If creating this note fulfills a task (e.g., booking flights), mark the task as completed, note the completion date, and link the relevant note.



## 5. Related Notes

- Notes created during the project that have reusable value:
    - General tips for flying.
    - Where to find cheap flights.
    - Notes about places visited or unique experiences (e.g., [[Brahmamuhurta]]).
    - Concepts or learnings discovered while traveling.


## 6. Useful Travel Notes

- Notes tagged with `#on/travel-planning` that are helpful for organizing travel.
    - Examples:
        - [[How to find cheap flights]]
        - [[How to get vaccines for traveling]]
        - Packing checklists:
            - Tech
            - Clothes
            - Documents
            - Toiletries


## 7. Journaling on the Trip

- Each day during your trip, create a travel journal entry:
    - Example:
        - On [[2024-12-28]], create [[2024-01-01 Day 1 - Sri Lanka - Touch down and Restaurant]].
        - On [[2024-12-29]], create [[2024-12-29 Day 2 - Sri Lanka - Hike and Skinidip]].
- Daily notes ([[2024-12-28]], [[2024-12-29]]) log linear details like exercise, sleep, and activities.
- Journal notes ([[2024-12-28 Day 1 - Sri Lanka - Touch down and Restaurant]], [[2024-12-29 Day 2 - Sri Lanka - Hike and Skinidip]]) tell the story of your trip. Think of these as personal travel blogs:
    - Add pictures from your daily notes.
    - Write them as engaging narratives that you’ll enjoy revisiting later.
