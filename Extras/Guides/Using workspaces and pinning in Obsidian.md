## **What is the use-case?**

In a digital world filled with endless information and multitasking, staying organized and focused can be a challenge. This is where Obsidian’s Workspaces and Pinning features come in handy. Workspaces allow you to create customized layouts for different projects, while Pinning helps you keep essential notes readily accessible. Whether you’re managing multiple projects, switching between different contexts, or simply want quick access to frequently used notes, these tools can significantly enhance your productivity. In this article, we'll explore why these features are valuable and provide guidance on when and how to use them effectively.

## **Workspaces**

1. **Activate the Core Plugin**
    
    - Go to: `Settings` > `Core Plugins` > `Workspaces` (Activate the plugin).
2. **Open Tabs to Include in the Workspace**
    
    - Open the desired tabs you want to include in the workspace. You can see a square with a number in the bottom right corner, which indicates the number of open tabs.
    - Add more tabs as needed. Once you've opened all the pages you want to include, you can save them as a workspace.
3. **Save the Workspace**
    
    - Tap the icon with three parallel lines in the bottom right corner.
    - Select: `Manage Workspace Layouts` > Enter the name of your workspace > `Save`.
4. **Open a Saved Workspace**
    
    - Tap the three parallel lines in the bottom right corner.
    - Select: `Manage Workspace Layouts` > Choose your saved workspace.
5. **Editing a workspace**

	- the same steps as creating a new workspace, but use exactly the same name as an existing one.
    
    You can create and manage as many workspaces as you like. Workspaces are transferable between devices as long as the workspaces plugin is active on both devices.

## **Pinning Notes**

1. **Pin a Note**
    
    - Open the note you want to pin.
    - Tap the three dots in the top right corner > Select `Pin`.
2. **Open Pinned Notes**
    
    - Tap the square icon with a number in the bottom right corner (this represents the currently open tabs).
    - You will see a list of pinned tabs here.

**Important Note:** Pinned pages are saved within workspaces. If you have a note pinned in one workspace but not in another, it will not appear pinned across different workspaces. Workspaces override the pinning status of notes.
