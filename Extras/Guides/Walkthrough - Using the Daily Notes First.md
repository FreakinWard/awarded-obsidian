## Theory
- [[Daily Notes First Methodology]]

## Walkthrough

- Purpose: Help you understand how the daily note works in this vault.


### Start with the daily note

- Click on calendar to create the daily note
	- [[2024-08-04]]
		- Metadata
			- Purpose:
				- The last 4 metadata fields are used to produce the navigation window. It works through the "Journals" community plugin.
				- We have some tracking logs like log-sleep-hours, log-sleep-rating, log-healthy-eating, log-day-rating which gets sent to the rollup notes (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly)
				- We use a scale of -2 (being the worst) to 2 (being the best)

		- Navigation Window
			- Purpose:
				- Easily navigate through your journal notes and between days
			- ![[Pasted image 20240912145200.png]]
		- Daily pictures
			- Purpose:
				- We are visual thinkers - think through pictures
				- Capture key moments of your day with some visuals.

		- Morning Pages
			- Purpose: 
				- Review previous year's notes (today a year ago)
					- Allows for reflection and serendipity
					- I also use it to reconnect with people
				- Word Vomit
					- Allows your to get everything out of your head and onto paper

		- Log Pages
			- Purpose: 
				- This is a breadcrumb trial that you leave for yourself
				- See exactly what you are spending your time on
				- Any thoughts and ideas (stray or not stray) are captured here in the [[Logredis Methodology]] structure - and get's fed or sent to the appropriate home notes or MOC's
				- All information gets logged here.

		- Evening Review
			- Purpose:
				- This is where you reflect on your day and what you did
				- I also include my `#log/daily-food` to capture (roughly) what I ate that day.
