### Persistent

### Folders

- Considerations
	- Be on the edit screen - not reading mode!
	- When you create a note give it a minute to load on the other side
	- Establishing a new connection can take up to 5min
		- Same with adding removing folders/notes
	- When sharing URL give time for note to load
	- Peerdraft stop sharing
		- If it does not work - WAIT
- Features
	- Allows for multiple notes to be shared
	- Working on canvasses
	- Offline editing!
	- it tells you what note a collaborator is working on (sometimes)
	- Can share individual shared notes to URL for someone not using Obsidian
